# 0x0A. C - argc, argv
## The arguments of the main function with prototype: int main(int argc, char* argv[]);
The argv (argument vector) is an array of strings in C and C++ that holds the command-line arguments passed to a program when it is executed. It is often used in conjunction with the argc (argument count) parameter to access and process command-line arguments.

Here's a breakdown of how argv works:

    Declaration in main Function:

        In C and C++, the main function typically has the following signature:

    
   `int main(int argc, char *argv[])`

        argc is an integer parameter that represents the number of command-line arguments.
        argv is an array of pointers to characters (strings) that holds the actual command-line argument values.

Accessing Command-Line Arguments:

    You can access individual command-line arguments by indexing into the argv array. The first argument (the program name) is at argv[0], the second argument is at argv[1], and so on.
    The argc parameter tells you the total number of arguments, so you can iterate through argv from argv[0] to argv[argc-1] to access all the arguments.

Example:

    Consider the following command line:

    bash

        ./my_program arg1 arg2 arg3

        In this example:
            argv[0] contains "./my_program".
            argv[1] contains "arg1".
            argv[2] contains "arg2".
            argv[3] contains "arg3".
            argc is set to 4 to indicate that there are four command-line arguments.

    Usage:
        Command-line arguments can be used to customize the behavior of a program or to provide input data. Programmers often parse and process these arguments to determine what actions the program should take.

    String Data Type:
        It's important to note that the elements of the argv array are strings (character arrays). You may need to convert them to other data types (e.g., integers) using functions like atoi or strtol if you intend to use them as numeric values.

    Error Handling:
        When working with command-line arguments, it's essential to handle unexpected argument counts or invalid input gracefully to avoid runtime errors.

In summary, argv is an array that holds the actual values of command-line arguments passed to a program, while argc tells you how many arguments have been provided. Programmers use these parameters to make their programs more versatile and to respond to user-provided input when the program is executed from the command line.

In C and C++, argc is an integer variable that is often used as an argument to the main function to represent the count (number) of command-line arguments passed to a program when it is executed.

Here's what argc stands for:

    argc: It stands for "argument count." This variable holds the count of command-line arguments passed to the program. It includes the name of the program itself as the first argument.

In a typical main function signature, you'll see both argc and argv:

c

`int main(int argc, char *argv[])`

Here's a brief explanation of argc and how it's used:

    argc: It is an integer value that indicates the number of command-line arguments. It is always greater than or equal to 1 because the program name itself is considered an argument.

For example, consider the following command line:

bash

`./myprogram arg1 arg2 arg3`

    argc would be set to 4 because there are four command-line arguments, including the program name (./myprogram).

    argv (argument vector): It is an array of strings (array of pointers to characters) that holds the actual command-line arguments. argv[0] is the program name, argv[1] is "arg1", argv[2] is "arg2", and argv[3] is "arg3".

You can use argc to determine how many command-line arguments were provided, and you can use argv to access and process those arguments within your program. This allows your program to be more flexible and configurable, as it can behave differently based on the command-line arguments it receives.
